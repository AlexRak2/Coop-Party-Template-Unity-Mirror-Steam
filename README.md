# Coop Party Template for Unity with Mirror and Steam

This is an advanced cooperative party system template designed for Unity, utilizing Mirror for networking and Steamworks for Steam integration.

I've developed this template for a project I'm currently working on and decided to share it with the community for free. This template provides a cooperative main menu system. You can create a party, join an existing party, find a match, or start in single-player mode.

One of the features of this template is its integration with Steam. You'll find a friends list menu where you can invite your Steam friends to join your party. All lobby connections are handled using Steam lobbies. All players must ready up in order to start the game. The game consist of a basic fps controller and demo scene. Enough for you guys to make a game out of.

## Testing Locally

If you want to test this template locally using Parallel Sync, follow these steps:

- Change the Transport on `MyNetworkManager` to KCP Transport.
- Disable the FizzySteam component.

Vice versa, if you wish to utilize Steam integration, revert these changes. This is mainly to test locally with two instances or use Steam to test with friends.
